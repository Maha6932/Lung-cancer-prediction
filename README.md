# ü©∫ Lung Cancer Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest** models to predict **lung cancer patient survival outcomes** using clinical data, aiming to identify key prognostic factors and support personalized, data-driven treatment planning.

---

## üìå Project Objective

- Develop and compare predictive models to estimate **treatment outcomes and survival probabilities** in lung cancer patients.
- Identify key predictors, such as **AJCC stage, smoking status, and treatment type**, that influence survival.
- Support **personalized, data-driven clinical decision-making** in oncology.

---

## ü©ª Data Overview

The dataset includes:

- **Vital Status** (Alive/Dead) ‚Äì Target variable.
- **AJCC Pathologic Stage** (I, II, III, IV with subcategories).
- **Treatment Type** (Chemotherapy, Radiation, Surgery, etc.).
- **Tobacco Smoking Status** (Non-Smoker, Current Smoker, Reformed Smoker).
- **Demographics** (Gender, Race).
- Additional variables like **age at diagnosis** and **pack years smoked**.

Data preprocessing involved **cleaning missing values, recoding categories, and preparing the dataset for modeling**.

| Sensitivity | 27%                  | 70%           | **80%**       |
| Specificity | 32%                  | 73%           | **83%**       |
| Precision   | 35%                  | 63%           | **78%**       |
| F1 Score    | 30%                  | 66%           | **79%**       |
| AUC         | 0.70                 | 0.71          | **0.81**      |

‚úÖ **Random Forest achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics.**
